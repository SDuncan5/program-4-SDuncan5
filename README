Demonstration of handling a mesh with no normals included in default execution, 
the mesh with no normals is the only bunny in the scene, located behind the initial camera in the distance.
The bunny is also the mesh that changes color when pressing "m".

The wolf is texture mapped, but the texture doesn't fit too well. (Definitely going to figure out the original)
